# Linked Lists <br/>
<br/>
A linked list is a data structure in which the objects are arranged in linear order.  Linked lists provide a simple, flexible representation for dynamic sets. <br/>
<br/>
Linked memory stores data together with a "link" to the location, in memory, of the next /and previous node depending on whether the list is singly or doubly linked. <br/>
<br/>
In C++, these lists are sequential lists of nodes.  A list node has both the data and accompanying link(s).  A linked list has zero or more ListNode elements linked together. <br/>
<br/>
Linked lists have a pointer called the "head pointer" that stores the link to the beginning of the list.  Linked lists have a pointer to the nullptr marking the end of the list which is called the tail. <br/>
